Q1. What is a Python library and how do you use one?
A Python library is basically someone else's code you can put in your own program.
In fact, you can make libraries yourself and upload them to the internet for people to use.
You can use one using the syntax 'import modulename' at the top of your code.

Q2. What does it mean for elements of circuits to be in series? What does it mean for them to be in parallel?
If two elements are in series, the end of one connects to the start of the other.
However, if two elements are in parallel, they both run at the same time, with the circuit splitting into two.

Q3. Is it possible to create a circuit with 3 LEDs in series? Why or why not?
It is infact possible, as electrical current flows into the LED, and, importantly, comes back out.
This means if you link the end of one LED to the start of another and complete the circuit as normal, both should light up.
